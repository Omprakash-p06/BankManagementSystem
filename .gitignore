# Sensitive Data / Configuration (IMPORTANT!)
# Your application.properties should generally not contain real passwords.
# If it does, and you want to commit the file, ensure sensitive values are placeholders
# and real values are provided via environment variables during deployment.
# For example, if you have a real DB password in application.properties,
# you would uncomment the line below and ensure it's NEVER committed.
# src/main/resources/application.properties
